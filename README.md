<h1>Geohash Reverse Geocode</h1>
<p>This project is an assesment task that consists of a simple admin panel to add coordinates for making polygon. The project uses geohash technique to encode location coordinates into geohash. Also, the app can be run in both web and mobile as the pages are built responsive.</p>
<p>This project includes the following features.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Update Geohash Dataset description</li>
  <li>Update Geohash Dataset meta-tags (Province name and ward number)</li>
  <li>Update Geohash polygon color</li>
  <li>Add geohash coordinates in Geohash Dataset</li>
  <li>Reverse geocode using Baato Reverse Search API</li>
  <li>Delete geohash coordinates from Geohash Dataset</li>
  <li>Search geohash by address</li>
</ul>

<p>Before running the app, please replace <a href="https://github.com/Suryaghising/Geohash-reverse-geocode/blob/main/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml">"your_key_here"</a> with Google API key in line number 8.</p>

<p>Also, please replace <a href="https://github.com/Suryaghising/Geohash-reverse-geocode/blob/main/lib/utils/constants.dart">baato_api_key</a> with your Baato API Key in line number 2.</p>

<h2>Update Geohash Dataset details</h2>
<img src="https://github.com/Suryaghising/Geohash-reverse-geocode/blob/main/screenshots/update_details.png">
<ul>
  <li>Users can update the details of Geohash Dataset by clicking the edit icon and filling the form.</li>
  <li>Description, meta-tags and color properties can be updated.</li>
  <li>When the color of Geohash Dataset is changed, the updated color will be visible in map's polygon as well as the selected chip's background.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Add Geohash</h2>
<img src="https://github.com/Suryaghising/Geohash-reverse-geocode/blob/main/screenshots/add_geohash.png">
<ul>
  <li>To add new geohash, user has to move the marker to the desired location and click the Add button.</li>
  <li>When user clicks the button, the app makes request to <a href="https://docs.baato.io/#/v1/services/reverse">Baato Reverse Search API</a> to extract address details from location coordinates.</li>
  <li>When the data is stored in server, a new marker is added in the map and polygon is updated in realtime.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Info Window</h2>
<img src="https://github.com/Suryaghising/Geohash-reverse-geocode/blob/main/screenshots/infowindow.png">
<ul>
  <li>When user clicks on any marker, a info window is popped which includes the details of the geohash.</li>
  <li>The details include geohash code which is generated by <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_geo_hash">Flutter Geo Hash</a>, location coordinate (latitude, longitude) and the address.</li>
  <li>Also, when the marker is tapped, the chip with related data in panel window gets selected.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Geohash Search</h2>
<img src="https://github.com/Suryaghising/Geohash-reverse-geocode/blob/main/screenshots/search.png">
<ul>
  <li>User can search geohashes by entering the address.</li>
  <li>To limit the function repetition call on continuous typing, debounce feature has been implemented using timer.</li>
  <li>The minimum length for input string is set to 3. Any input with less than 3 letters will return the whole list.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>There are few limitations of the project which are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The map cannot be moved freely in mobile view when there are so many geohashes because the whole of the home component has been wrapped by SingleChildScrollView to make search functionality better. However it works fine in web and in mobile, it's good with less geohashes (probably less than 8).</li>
  <li>To add geohash, country is required. However, Baato Reverse Search API does not provide country detail. More specifically, the data from the API have been manually handled and some data might be misplaced. (eg: Kathmandu is being saved in place of country).</li>
  <li>The markers cannot be updated once they have been added. User will have to manually delete and add a new marker to update the coordinates.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About System requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To setup the project, required Flutter version is <b>"=3.2.3 <4.0.0"</b> and above.</li>
    <li>To run the app, minimum Android SDK required is 20 i.e. <a href="https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platforms#4.4w">Android 4.4w</a></li>
    <li>Also, the app can be run in browsers like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
<ul>
  <li>This project can be run in Android Studio, VS Code and/or any other preferred code editors/IDEs.</li>
